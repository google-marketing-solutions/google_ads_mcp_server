## Testing Instructions

- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Find the CI plan in the `.github/workflows/` folder.
- Any commit should pass all the tests, linting, and formatting checks by way of
  the `pre-commit` hooks before you merge.
- Fix any test or type errors until the whole suite is green.
- Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.
